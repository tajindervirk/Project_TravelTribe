# Travel Tribe
This is a project website called Travel Tribe where people can list their homes , rooms , houses , villas, camping grounds, etc..  for travellers across the globe for their stay. I've implemented  Authentication using passport, MVC  model and used express-sessions mongo-session store to store the session data and used Mapbox or Geocoding the locations.
